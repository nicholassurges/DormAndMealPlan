# DormAndMealPlan

VISUAL BASIC PROGRAMMING --Dorms - A university has the following dormitories, offered at these prices:

Allen Hall                     $2,500 per semester

Pike Hall                       $2,200 per semester

Farthing Hall                 $2,100 per semester

University Suites          $2,800 per semester

Let us also assume the university offers the following meal plans:

7 meals per week                     $1,560 per semester

14 meals per week                   $2,095 per semester

Unlimited meals                       $2,500 per semester

Create an application with a module and two forms. The module holds defined constants for the various dormitories and meal plans. The startup form holds the names of the dormitories, a set of buttons, a status bar, and labels that display semester charges, as shown below. A second form holds the list of meal plans, and selection buttons, as also shown below. When the user selects a dormitory and meal plan, the application should show the total charges for the semester on the startup form.

Note: Use code statements in the Form Load event handler for each form to initialize the list boxes with the names of the dormitories or meal plans, along with their prices. This must be done at runtime, to allow future changes in the values of price constants to be displayed correctly in the list boxes.
